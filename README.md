# TokenSniffer
A proof-of-concept Discord token highjacker. It is capable of obtaining the user token of the active discord account if Discord is running by searching the string '"token"' in process memory. Takes about 350ms to find. 

**THIS IS MERELY A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT. DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE TO AQUIRE AN INDIVIDUAL'S TOKEN WITHOUT HIS CONSENT.**
